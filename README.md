##About Mojave Locker

This is a prototype of an application that allows my friend, an Army Blackhawk pilot, to catch up on missed events, life milestones, and pop culture fads that occured during her deployment. Mojave is built on a MEAN stack. 

Mojava Locker is a labor of love. So if you have any tips or suggestions put in a pull request or email me at <a href="mailto: stephanie.reaves@gmail.com" target="_blanl=k"> Stephanie.Reaves [at] gmail [dot] com </a>. Hope you have a blast!
